# PTGI & RTGI REQUIRED 
> [!WARNING]
> **(SPECIFICALLY v0.36.1 FOR RTGI) & (FOR THE PTGI FILE DM ME ON DISCORD, ALSO YOU MUST OWN RTGI; @memvry)**

This shader was targeted for more of a realism look rather than a Vibrant & Saturated preset that's most often used in majority of the presets you can find.
- Note that some games might look off, working on the shaders currently to work with most games

> [!NOTE]
> Instructions to install the preset
- Make sure you have [Bloxshade](https://bloxshade.com/) set up.
- Drop your preferred preset into "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Ansel\Custom"
